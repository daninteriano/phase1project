# phase1project
Creating a Single Page Application where I submit titles that i want to read. There will be a form on the page where i submit the Manga Titles that I want to read, and like a "To-Do List" they will stay on the DOM. 
Once a Manga Title "Submitted" there will be two buttons alongside it, where one Button will say "Read" which will then trigger an event where a 5 star rating will appear under the title. 
There other Button will be a simple remove button.
