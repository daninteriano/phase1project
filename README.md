# Manga Tracker

# Usage
For users who want to make a list of Manga titles that they want to read, followed by a completed button that will then allow the user to rate the title if they so choose, using a 5 star rating system. Once a user has concluded their enjoyment of the title, they also have an option to remove it at any point in time.
