# Manga Tracker

# Usage
For users who want to make a personal list of Manga titles that they want to read or have already read, and want somewhere online to keep it stored.
The user will simply enter the title of the manga they wish to read into the input field provided. 
From there a title will be listed below the input field. 
The title name, an cover image for the title, as well as a pair of button will populate. 

Included in the pair of buttons is a Done button as well as a delete button.
The Done button will signify that a title has been read, and will then allow the user to rate the title if they so choose, using a simple heart button to signify a positive reaction or a thumbs down showing a negtive reaction to the title.
Once a user has concluded their enjoyment of the title, they also have an option to remove it at any point in time simply clicking on the delete button.

# Roadmap
In the future I plan to integrate a star rating system for more detailed informatoin. With personalization in mind, a category sorting method that separates the titles by genre will also be a key feature.
